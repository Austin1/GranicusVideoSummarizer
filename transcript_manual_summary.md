The meeting was attended by various members with the exception of the Speaker of the House and the Comptroller of the Treasury. The discussion was about the construction and design of two main projects, one for the Department of General Services and the other for the Department of Military.

1. Department of General Services: Commissioner Christy Branscomb presented a proposal for a contract for the construction of a headquarters building on the multi-agency law enforcement training academy (MELITA). The proposal was the best evaluated among five proposals received on May 11, 2023, and the intent to award was issued on June 5, 2023. However, since there is a 7-day protest period, the item will be referred to the ESC meeting on June 20th with the authority to act on the contract. A groundbreaking is expected in the early fall.

2. Department of Military: Colonel Andrew Milligan presented on behalf of Brigadier General Ross, asking for approval of the early design phase of the new Campbell National Guard Readiness Center. The design complies with both National Guard Bureau and Fort Campbell requirements. They expect Congressional funding for the project in the next federal fiscal year, 2024. The design presented was very prescriptive and was approved by the Bureau Personnel for its type, size, and overall cost. The project was approved by the attendees and will move forward. The attendees were informed that they would be notified about the dedication of the facility when it's ready.

The video transcript covers three main agenda items related to the University of Tennessee, presented by Austin Oaks, the assistant vice-president of a project:

1. The first request is related to the approval of a pre-development agreement for a public-private partnership associated with a housing project in Knoxville. The agreement is the first part of the project, setting up roles and responsibilities of the involved parties. There were queries from the commission regarding the inclusion of condominiums in the construction, but Oaks clarified that they are currently in a Request for Information (RFI) process about potential projects like a hotel, condos, and dining and entertainment needs around Neyland Stadium.

2. The second request pertains to the approval of a master plan presented by a company called ERSink Gross. This master plan, which resulted from a 16-month process, covers both the Knoxville campus and the contiguous UTA campus as well as the Space Institute campus. The key highlights of the master plan include accommodating growth in research, student housing, and academic facilities due to significant enrollment growth, and managing 25% of the facilities in poor condition through renovation or demolition. The plan also anticipates approximately 8,000 additional in-person students on campus in the next decade and recognizes the need to meet significant student housing needs by adding about 5,000 additional beds (with 3,000 net new beds). The master plan also addresses infrastructure planning including transit, stormwater management, and open space.

3.  The third request was for the approval of a master plan for the University of Tennessee Chattanooga, presented by DLR Group. The key points of the plan include settling all the University's needs within its existing property, considering partnerships with ongoing urban development around the university, planning to replace housing facilities that don't satisfy return on investment, and relocating recreational and athletic facilities back to campus from their current off-campus location. The plan also discusses future steps, such as expanding health sciences and interdisciplinary research, infilling research centers, and replacing existing housing with support spaces for the residential learning community.
