At this point we are asking to refer this item to the ESC meeting on June 20th with the authority to act 2the contract we are on schedule for the project and they cmgc for the headquarters building

groundbreaking early fall so just in a few short months so what weask for your approval to retain a motion to refer this to Executive sub and properly moved and seconded all in favorsay I  you proved the most like you commissioner  it kind of Paul she said there was going to bea groundbreaking and she said we want to ask for your and I thought this was take presents but then she said approval so I think she liked what I meant to say presents absolutelyhave will there be a lot of time in advance to get your schedules planned for it  the next side of mangoing to military the next time of the agendas for the Department of military we have Colonel Andrew Milligan here to present the sideColonel Andrew Milligan presenting on behalf of Brigadier General Ross and appreciate you allowing me to percent today on on his behalf we have one item for your consideration on Page 6 is for the newCampbell National Guard Readiness Center and we are requesting approval of the early design phase the designer for the project is Lao cook Martin and Mr Lane Lisle will be presenting to you todaythe National Guard Bureau uses a very prescriptive program for these congressionally-approved facilities they carefully control the type and the sizes of the spaces within the buildingand the overall cost interesting to note that Bureau Personnel review every design phase as we progressed and approve those as we go forward and they makethat we stay within the authorizations that they have approved for for funding in the future the in addition because this site is on Fort Campbell their Department of Publicworks also has design oversight on the project they have to provide construction and compliance reviews and we have to continue to to satisfyrequirements is the building goes forward the design being presented to you today complies with both National Guard Bureau in Fort Campbell requirements and it does not allow us to deviate as the projectcan you pass this present presentation Congressional funding for the project is expected in the next federal fiscal year and 24 and that works well with the design schedulequestions  is there motion  and is that Stu executive soberokay but they need to have the presentation  all right formationI'll try to be brief and so I can call him Andy cuz he's a neighbor has a 5086 page document that guarantees this building will look like your second but we tried to up that game a little bit I'm through 33 quicklysince Kentucky which is unusual and on a federal property which makes for an interesting mix of regulations which and her staff has help us help us work throughthe site in the circle to the left you can see downtown Clarksville it's about 15 miles from the heart of downtown to the sidethis is zooming out a little bit further against a little bit more of the site we will access the site through gate 7 which fortuitously is the contractor's entrance to the Postgate for us down here on the lower right those of you that busy Fort Campbell will typically go through that gate  this is a close-up view the entire site is currentlyCupid by the National Guard and it is used as a tracked vehicle maintenance facility you can see tanks and Bradley's park there in that parking lot we will take possession for our prodigyapproximately half the side below the red dotted line which requires us to move a five thousand foot square foot unheated storage facility and build some new parking on itall utilities that are needed are there and we'll have a very favorable site to work with its well-drained  is our current site planning as Colonel Sandersand everything is very prescriptive down to exactly how many parking spaces you have how much square footage of concrete you can have and how big the building can be within 10% of their of their programwe have to the front of the building of the building main entrance orients itself to the primary Access Road Market Garden and across the street is the division parade ground whichnice nice things for the bill we tried to make the building Orient toward that view and then the controlled entrance is there to the rear and what's called a military baseservice area we will have connections between the existing use facility  this is the floor plan and again is a colonel said it's highly for script if we tried to organize it as mostI called him armories most Armory surround what's now called assembly used to be called a drill Hall the green zone is the lobby entrance which contains a family waiting room requirethe office and the ncos office which monitors the public entrance which will be rare into this facility will also have this place located there and yellow flanking the infantscontrol from that point our classrooms and training training rooms and the administrative Suite then down to the lower left would be true lockers for theCooper's there shower rooms and and bathrooms which also double function to serve the Assembly Hall and can be secured the other areas can be secured when it's only the Assembly Hall being youstraight up above the Assembly Hall is the unit equipment storage and and the arms fault and then to the upper left sideis a maintenance training by because that's one of their missions is continues to be big with Mindless  this is an aerial rendering of the side you can see theEstates for sale that's the only color that's not dry up on the entire post those blue rooms and you can pick them out from from a mile away so I'll facilities located here on the leftmentioned the main entrance facing the parade ground parking on either side you can see the military vehicle area behind immediately above that is the base which is also canwhat is the base vehicle wash facility everything coming out of the maneuver areas it's dirty gets cleaned up there this is our front entrance we hope to I'll be able to put the guardI'll go where it's highly visible day and night behind that that second story of glass there and have a nice Lobby feature which is about the only designed affect we able to getthis is the rear view showing the the drill Hall in the middle the locker and staff support area on the right and the training facilities on the leftis Mac safe for this project to 17419 500 our bed Target 16-5-90 our current estimate which includesalternates listed to the ride is showing the project below the budget and  we hope that stays any questionssinon thank you for your presentation  requesting ayes sir is there a motion for approval of proper motion proper second all in favor say ayethank you and Sarah Powers good to have you with us  thank you thank you you let us know when the groundbreakingwhen they're ready for the dedication of the facility will will try to get a delegation up there thank youthank you Colonel appreciate your presentation thank you  next item is Han the next time on the agenda is for the University of Tennessee we haveassistant vice-president of a project Austin Oaks here today 2%  good to have you with us good morning governor and members of the commissionexpress my appreciation for allowing me to present on behalf of President void today the University of Tennessee has three requests for your consideration are firstquestions on page 7 of your packet and this request is related to the approval of a pre-development agreement for a public-private partnership associated with the housing P3project in Knoxville this agreement is The First Agreement is part of the project and identifies the roles and responsibilities of the parties between now and when we come to aground lease which we will bring forward to this commission for approval we're happy to answer any questions you may have about the public-private partnershiprequest for approval of that item  thank you will  we'll take up the  take them up separately and first will bepublic-private partnership agreement do we have any questions on that  can chairman Austin and I may haveunderstood on the front end of this are we now including the construction of condos contemplation of Condominiumsthinking about if I got them mixed up so there is the university is currently in a RFI processor request for information process and that process cannot andin the award of a contract that does not an RFP which would end in a contract so we are pursuing an RFI right now associated with Neyland Stadium that looks at a hotelthe condos in it also looks at some dining and entertainment needs in that area will be getting results from the RFI and approximately a month and that will help informnice as to how we would best construct a request-for-proposal process before we issue an RFP this body would see and have an opportunity to readI appreciate you're very polite way of telling me I was mistaken I move approval  is there a sec properly seconded all in favor say ayethe pre pre planning agreement free development agreement for publicthe partnership passes the next time is the master plan for utk and contiguous campus locations for t u tSI  is there a discussion on that  yes sir to our second request this is Paige a does for the approval of a master plan is presented by air sinkgross and this is for the Knoxville master plan this presentation encompasses both the Knoxville campus and the contiguous UTA campus as well as the space Institute campuswith me today is Kevin Peterson principal with are synchros who's been working with us for the past year-and-a-half with your permission we'd like to ask Kevin to join us to Brazilmaster plan to the commission  I'll be fineBoston  so that the UT master plan was the result of a 16-month process that engaged the campus community and resulted in a seriesplanning principles that really aligned with the University's academic and strategic goals  the university is aarise their significant enrollment growth that's occurring at UT so there really two primary drivers to this master plan the first is to accommodate growth in research student housingand general enrollment growth for academic facilities and the second is the renewal of facilities about 25% of the facilities when they were assessed were in poor conditionso there are really three primary ways that the master plan is dealing with the authorities in poor condition the first is buildings that are obsolete or being demolishedabout 900,000 square feet there's major renovation to about 1.35 million square feet those are buildings that we are changing the use for doing comprehensive Renovations and then1.4 million square feet is really being incrementally address their deferred maintenance to those facilities  the space needs to look at theall 2021 enrollment as well as the fall 2030 enrollment the 10-year enrollment projections approximately 8000 additional in person students on campusthere's also significant growth in faculty and staff to support both on campus and in Virtual teaching as well as significant research growth on the campusthe university also needs to address the University Austin needs to Justin significant student housing needs so you can see by this slide showing theman of student housing the plan is to add about 5,000 a digital bads 3000 net new bad so two thousand of those bags will be replacement and that's really weirdrounding to the market demand to meeting the student needs moving forward  so to accommodate these needs UT will mostly be looking to in totalI meant on its campus but some programs are best suited off campus location so to Dad and the master plan is included at one point five radius boundary from its Center Pointcampus these are areas considered a key Partnerships and program needs in the future this area is accessible by transit and accessible through pedestriansdirections as well from the core of Campus University is not plan to acquire property in historic Fort Sanders neighborhood or the Maplehurst neighborhood  so there's really three key strategyI want to highlight from the master plan these really a line with the Strategic plan the first is to be more interdisciplinary and how we think about the Sylhet he's in the future for both academic and readcollaborations the second is to strengthen student life and the third is to enhance academic connections across campusexisting Hobbs at the Hill Circle Park as well as new Hobbs at Melrose for the School of Business new hubs for the Arts and Humanities as well as the neighborhoodto grow residential population that's proximate the campus and really connecting the campus both north-south and East-West  so the projects are grouped intowhere is the near term projects medium and long-term projects the near-term projects really address all geographical areas at campus they include renovation as well as new construction the projaccommodate the needs of Campus Life academics research as well as student housing the five key academic buildings are new chemistry building anddisciplinary Humanities classroom building an interdisciplinary health research and clinical building as well as a resource building at the dabney-buehler site and an academic buildingactivating Andy Holt and certain classrooms adjacent to the residence Halls  the midterm projects accommodate the remaining 10-year needs of growth for the University with newreplacement facilities at both of UTA campus to support and that mad the research campus at Cherokee Farm as well as instructional Hobbs at the walltight site and facilities at the u t space Institute  and lastly there are long-term project these are beyond the needs of the master planbut the master plan did identify which sites would be best suited for academic residential and other uses to really preserve them for future planning and consideration if neededand then the last thing I want to touch on is that the master plan also deals with infrastructure planning Transit stormwater management as well as open space this is Chapman Drive which is the heart of the eyecampus and really transforming and continuing the transforming a public space creating a more pedestrian campus to reduce the need for vehicular driving and really promote walking in Accessquality throughout campus  so with that the overall plan responds with goals and momentum of the university on the rise in church stewardship of its existing resourcesover 3 about 3 million square feet of Renew on major renovation the new facility is really support the growth in both research and residential and academic.how do you say and then really kind of meeting the student housing needs in the future so that I want to thank you and I'm happy to answer any questions  questionsthank you for this I appreciate it I want to do it where are their budget estimates that are included with this yeah the total planwe do provide budget estimates in today's dollars yes and then yes okay thank youthe Fraternity Row and Sorority row or those being moved through there is gross and need in the fraternity so we've identified in the area where the growth canfraternities Ygnacio, late replacement of any of those houses that need to be moved but it's not contemplated that the fraternities are being moved as part of this master play but but you could out of Comedy anymore how is isturn area of the area on Caledonia is identified for growth of those paternity facilities  other questionsis there motion properly moved and seconded all in favor say ayenext item the saint  the next item is also for the University of Tennessee with Austin Oaks are 2% and it will beostentation is well thank you are third and final request today is for the approval of the master plan as presented by DLR group for the unitcity of Tennessee Chattanooga I would like to introduce chrisanne osterby she is with a principal at the alarm has Burton been working with us over the pastyear year-and-a-half to develop this plan and after she has an opportunity to present happy to entertain any questions and would request for approval of the plangood morning members of the commission it's a pleasure to be with you  so this planas has been unfolding and was taking place at the same time that the Strategic plan and the academic plan was also being confirmed by UTthe planning goals that you see here come directly from facilitating the implementation of those two plans probably the most important islooking at the projection and the goal to settle all of the University's needs within its existing property the planning boundary that you seehear the dashed line around planning district is essentially the same as it was 10 years ago it's moved a little further to the South to account forsignificant City development with an innovation district and additional interested Partners south of Martin Luther King Boulevard so the exactscene University property is in blue you'll see that all facilities with the addition of the sites highlighted in red which is a Cadet acquisition underway is able toaccommodated all projected needs you'll also see in the future slides that there are facilities that are moving purposely towards the edge of the campus Becausethe area shown in peach or partnership opportunities within the planning district they have been on the record for over a decade the university continues to speak with these Partners isas developers and cities and so you'll see an opportunity to link to that increasing Urban Development around the University  the facility wreckstations take into account the significant investment that's been made at the University of New facilities and revitalized repurposed facilities that you see highlighted in green and Lightscreen for buildings in excellent in good condition but more important he'll notice their gray facilities that was her critical recommended for demolition so Isending the highest and best use of those sites the facilities that are in red which are critical and some orange facilities in the core that are in poor conditionas part of understanding the space needs that needed to be served two things were looked at first of all the enrollment assessment demographics were consideredlooking back 10 years as well as forward 10 years was considered and most important according to the academic plan it was looking at anticipated both back.free programs Master's programs increasing research and continued hyflex and online learning so the space needs that come from that andto pay the demand for space both show at continuing me that exist today but will increasing in specialty instructional labswhich Lab special use face as well as the opportunity to actually reconfigure recapture revitalized space that is now used for classrooman office space is underutilized there's an additional significant Gap and Student Life space as you may know most of that is coming for a need for expandhousing both to replace housing that no longer requires return on investment or satisfies return on investment but it's also for increasing in thereflecting that they're very successful learning communities that are being established to meet that in as part of the academic success  so looking at thea vision plan this is the primary building news in red is the academic or you'll see the expanding research and academic facility planboth to the Northeast where Erlanger hospital is as well as other clinical and expanding Health Science needs there and then to the South andthe Southwest again reflecting The Innovation District expansion in the city  looking specifically at the yellow areas on that pass plan our housingdining locations that are recommended I realize the font is a little tight here but the top two lines in particular are showingalong with the third line of previously approved housing project as well as the complete replacement rebuilding of some existing housing facilities will see those aremustard with that idea of learning communities warehousing already exists on campus and the proposed dining to serve those students as well as other students support needsso in the short-term plan this is showing the project said actually summer already approved and underway summer under planning and thereexpansion of those anticipated highlighted in the circles here are those facility improvements that aretypically targeting like McClellan and Fletcher Hall the opportunity to improve existing facilities as well as where you're seeing on the topto the right and top to the bottom where facilities are being demolished and repurposing of that land is taking place in the midterm plan there's muchanticipating demand demand for facility improvements this is coming from again tracking the improvements in the midterm for enrollmentwell as the opportunity to reinvest and bring recreational and Athletics back to campus as needed to improve that Student Lifeexperience away from Finley Stadium on the other side of the city where they're currently located so again those major recommendations are dealing either with vacated spacedemolished apartment buildings on the left or angle Stadium reinvestment on the right the vision plan itself going out 10 plus yearsis fully tracked its part of the space needs assessment and so these are critical zones again if enrollment warrants and the academic programming is successso again in the vision plan it's taking advantage of demolition of Housing and surface parking lots for better uses shown onbottom and on the top again the removal and replacement of existing Challenger building site incorporating it into stem facilities so the final recommendationthe campus plan are again to focus on the expansion of the already approved first phase of Health Sciences into a Health Science Squad anddisciplinary research quad near Erlanger and that the hospital expansion it's also to look at of a continuing infill and theseBrown centers of excellence for each college with the programming and the anticipated expansion of those successful programs to increasing research and graduate studyand also as we've talked about to replace existing housing and support spaces in those critical areas for the residential learning communityand finally for existing housing that is isolated provided by the foundation in the past from the main campus it's significantinvestment for those existing facilities and expanding learning communities and enrollment  so that concludes the presentation and be happy to answerquestions questions do you have the we have some estimates affiliated with the perfectly the first five years of
